# Lesson Instructions

The code in this repo was designed to teach students how to use C++ classes.
When I teach the lesson I also incorporate elements of the agile methodology
scrum. Scrum mainly features in the exercises where the students should be split into
groups of 3-4 students sharing one computer. They are then given a single task
to solve during a 15 minutes sprint. At the end of the 15 minutes the groups
present what they achieved, what went well, what could be better and what they
would like to change for the next sprint. Students should rotate who is typing
between each sprint. I also put post-its on a board with the items from the plan
and move them as we progress through the lesson. This is the plan I have used:
* Set up and welcome students
* Introduction to the lesson, goals and purpose
* What do you need to build an autonomous green house? The idea here is to interact with the students and to get them to understand how complex a software project can be and how classes help manage that complexity. We need software for water pumps, thermometers, humidity sensors and so on.
* What attributes does a pen have? Ask students. Make a list. Explain that a class is just a description of what can attributes and objects has and of what can be done with an object. For instance a pen has a colour. A specific object of the class Pen might have the colour red. It has the methods write() and erase(), a length and a weight.
* Look a C++ code example of a BankAccount class with a deposit and getBalance method.
* Short introduction to scrum and the coming exercises.
* Sprint 1 - Planning, sprint, review, retrospective
* Break
* Sprint 2
* Sprint 3
* Lesson over

The input to the sprint exercises are taken from the following **backlog**. I suggest writing the tasks out on post-its and pasting them on a white board.

1. Create a player called "Sara" and print the name of the player.
2. Create a tournament. Add two players to the tournament. Run the tournament and print the winner.
3. Create and run a tournament with four players.
4. Add an age attribute to the Player class.
5. Add a method to the Tournament class to be able to get a list of all participants.
6. Add a method to the Tournament that allows a user to see the mean age of the participants.
7. Add a method to the Tournament class that allows a user to get a result table of the tournament.
